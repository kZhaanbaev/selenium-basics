<h3> What is TestNG? </h3>

TestNG in Selenium is a Java testing framework, inspired by JUnit and NUnit.<br/> 
It overcomes the constraints and disadvantages of JUnit and introduces an entirely new set of properties, <br/>
making TestNG more powerful and easy to use. The suffix ‘NG’ stands for Next Generation, <br/>
signifying the new functionalities that TestNG brings to the table. From simple unit testing to complex integrated testing,<br/> 
it is designed to simplify all your testing requirements such as functional testing, regression, end-to-end testing, and more.
